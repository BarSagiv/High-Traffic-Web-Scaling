CloudFront caches and serves static content from S3, reducing latency for global users.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes incoming traffic to EC2 instances deployed in an Auto Scaling Group.
Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demands, ensuring cost-efficient scalability.
RDS with Read Replicas handles the database workload and scales read operations.
S3 stores static assets, which are served globally via CloudFront.
